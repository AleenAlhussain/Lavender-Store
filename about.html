She went from general managing a tech firm to starting a flower business from scratch. She always had a passion for flowers and design, and wanted to try something new. This was her chance, and so started La Lavande, with the hope of bringing something different to the existing Bay Area flower scene, a bit of a French touch.<br/><br/>Over the past 20 years, with a lot of hard work, many early flower market mornings and lots of determination, she built a thriving business that serves our local community of tech firms, restaurants, hotels, local residents, and of course many brides and grooms. In 2016, Nasrin decided that it was time to pass the reins over to me, her eldest daughter, Momo. We had been working together for many years, and I was ready to take La Lavande into its next chapter.<br/><br/>We're both so proud of what we've accomplished together and look forward to continuing to put smiles on faces across the San Francisco Bay Area.</span>
